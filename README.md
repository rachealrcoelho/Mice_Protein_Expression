The dataset contains expression levels of 77 proteins measured in the cerebral cortex of eight classes of mice.The 8 classes of mice are divided based on genotype,behaviour and treatment. 

The dataset is available to the public and it consists of a total of 1080 measurements per protein.The dataset has 82 columns and 1080 rows.The dataset is downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mice+Protein+Expression. 

The target feature is the class.So the impact of each type of protein is used to determine the class of mice.
